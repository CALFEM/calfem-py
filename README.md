## Background

The computer program CALFEM is written for the software MATLAB and is an
interactive tool for learning the finite element method. CALFEM is an abbreviation
of ”Computer Aided Learning of the Finite Element Method” and been developed
by the Division of Structural Mechanics at Lund University since the late 70’s.

## Why CALFEM for Python?
Unlike MATLAB, which have expensive licenses, Python is free to use and distribute
both for personal and commercial use. This is the python version of CALFEM for scientific purposes/research.
